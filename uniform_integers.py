Problem Description

A positive integer is considered uniform if all of its digits are equal.
	â€¢	For example, 222 is uniform, while 223 is not.

âœ… Task

Given two positive integers A and B, determine the number of uniform integers between A and B (inclusive).

Your solution must run within the time limit.

ğŸ“Œ Constraints
	â€¢	1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{12}

â¸»

ğŸ“Š Sample Test Case #1
	â€¢	Input:
A = 75
B = 300
	â€¢	Output:
Expected Return Value = 5
	â€¢	Explanation:
The uniform integers between 75 and 300 are:
77, 88, 99, 111, and 222

ğŸ“Š Sample Test Case #2
	â€¢	Input:
A = 1
B = 9
	â€¢	Output:
Expected Return Value = 9
	â€¢	Explanation:
All single-digit integers from 1 to 9 are uniform.

ğŸ“Š Sample Test Case #3
	â€¢	Input:
A = 999999999999
B = 999999999999
	â€¢	Output:
Expected Return Value = 1
	â€¢	Explanation:
The single number in the range is 999,999,999,999, which is uniform.
