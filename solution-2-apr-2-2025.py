'''
You are provided with a string of n lowercase English characters, where n ranges from 1 to 500 inclusive. Your task is to return a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a letter k and its corresponding numerical representation v.

The numerical representation v of each character k is computed as follows: replace k with the character that comes three characters before it in the alphabetical order (wrap around to z when this is less than a), then multiply the ASCII value of the new character by the frequency of k in the provided string.

Your function should return a dictionary of the letters in the string and their corresponding numerical representations, sorted in ascending order by the characters.

Each character's ASCII value can be obtained using Python's built-in ord function, and the character corresponding to an ASCII value can be obtained using the chr function.

The returned dictionary should be in the format:

Python
Copy to clipboard
{'character': numerical_representation}
For example, given the string 'abc', your function should return:

Python
Copy to clipboard
{'a': 120, 'b': 121, 'c': 122}
In this case, we replace 'a' with 'x' and multiply its ASCII value (120) by its frequency (1) to get 120. For 'b', we replace it with 'y' and multiply its ASCII value (121) by its frequency (1) to get 121. And for 'c', we replace it with 'z' and multiply its ASCII value (122) by its frequency (1) to get 122. Then, we sort them based on the characters.
